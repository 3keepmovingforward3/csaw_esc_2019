# The due date for the final report and video has been extended to 4 November 2019 at 11:55am (morning) eastern time. The final report in IEEE template format should be uploaded to HotCRP along with all associated computer files (e.g., sender.py for each solved challenge, documentation on use of files, Makefiles etc.) in TAR.GZ format.

# The ppt presentation should be sent to the organizers by 6 November 2019 at 11:55am (morning) eastern time. Teams can also send a copy of their poster by 6 November 2019 at 11:55am (morning) eastern time.



## Final Report

The final report should be no more than 8 pages including references and appendices. The report should focus on the process of your solving the challenges as well as the highlights of your techniques. Final reports should follow the format of a technical paper rather than a tutorial or description of how the team solved each challenge. The report is also an opportunity to impress the judges with your approach to the given problems as well as to highlight insights or how the team overcame difficulties in the challenge.



## Presentation

The ppt presentation is limited to ***5 minutes***. Due to the number of teams and timing constraints, your presentation will have to stop at exactly 5 minutes. The presentations must be sent to the organizers via email at **csaw-esc@nyu.edu** by 6 November 2019 at 11:55am eastern time. Presentations should follow a standard 4:3 PowerPoint presentation template.



## Video

The team video will be sent to the judges along with the final report and should be no more than 3 minutes. The video should highlight your approach, novel solutions, etc. Your video should be submitted using a **private Google Drive link** (anyone with the link outside your organization should be able to access it without login, but the video must remain private) on the paper due date of 4 November 2019 at 11:55am eastern time. You may include the video link in a clearly named, separate .txt in the TAR.GZ files.



## Poster

Teams will be provided with a 24inx36in (vertical orientation) foam core to display their poster. This can serve as a visual aid while speaking individually with the judges. Teams may print and bring their poster with them to the competition (the organizers cannot provide support for poster printing). Teams can provide a reference copy of their poster to the organizers via email at **csaw-esc@nyu.edu** by 6 November 2019 at 11:55am eastern time.
