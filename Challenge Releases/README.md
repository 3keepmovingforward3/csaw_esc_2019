# ESC'19 Challenge Releases

This folder contains all available challenge sets released so far. 
Each set contains independent challenges to solve and all points from all challenges will be accumulated in the final score 
of each team. Challenges are given a different number of points based upon their difficulty; 
the number of points for each challenge is revealed once the challenge is solved.

## Working Example
Each challenge has a unique name, such as `Stairs`.
The provided program `sender.py` should be updated to write to the RFID card the correct values to solve each challenge. 
To help the teams get started with a working example, we provide a preprogrammed `sender.py` file that solves the `Stairs` sample challenge in set A.
